# Appointment App (front end)


## About

In this application, I have an appointment app. The user can choose from a list of 
doctors and choose a date and time to make an appointment with the doctor at that time.

To build this application I used:

- Javascript ES6;
- Html/CSS;
- React;
- Redux;
- React-Redux;
- Jest;
- Create React App;
- React Hooks;
- React Router
- Linters ( eslint and stylelint)
